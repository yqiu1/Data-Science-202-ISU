## What is git?

- **Git** is a *version control system* that was created to help developers manage collaborative software projects. Git tracks the evolution of a set of files, called a **repository** or **repo**. 
- This helps us
    - *merge* conflicts that arise from collaboration
    - *rollback* to previous versions of files as necessary
    - store *master* versions of files, no more `paper_final_final_I_really_mean_it.docx`

(others are e.g. Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.).

## Your Turn (5 min)

This Your Turn is just a prep to get ready for the lab later. 
It'll take a couple of minutes of your time, but may need to wait for email confirmation from github ... 


Here goes: Do you have a github account? 

- No? Create a _free_ account at https://github.com/
- Yes? Then log into it. 
    - Do you remember your login and password?

## Git Terminology

from [github glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

- **Repository:** the basic element of git - like a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files, and their __revision history__. One person owns a repository, multiple people can collaborate. Can be either public or private.
- **Remote:** This is the version of something that is hosted on a server. It can be (and usually is) connected to a local clone.
- **Clone:** A local copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere
- **Fork:** a remote copy of a repository stored under your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original(master). 

## Terminology (cont'd)


- **Pull:** When you are fetching changes from the remote repository and merging them with your local clone. 
- **Commit:** A checkpoint for the local clone to save changes to a file (or set of files). Every time you commit, git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
- **Push:** Sending your committed changes to the remote repository.



## Terminology (cont'd)


- **Pull Request:** Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.
- **Issue:** Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. 






## Repositories

By default, all materials on GitHub are **public**. This is *good* because you are getting your work out there and contributing to the open source community! 

If you need **private** repos, checkout [GitHub for Education](https://education.github.com/) - free private repos for students/postdocs/professors.

## Looking ahead ... 

In this class we will use git & github for 

- lab assignments, and
- the projects.
