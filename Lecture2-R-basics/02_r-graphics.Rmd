# Looking at data

## Data Exploration

- asking good questions is important for any data exploration: "your data won't speak unless you ask the right questions"
- a data exploration is a cycle of asking questions, looking at the answers, and deriving new questions from them
- for a sound exploration: start by checking individual variables, then move on to higher dimensions

# An example exploration

<span style="color:white">
Write down questions that you could answer with this data 4 minutes by yourself, then pair up for another 3 minutes, and we'll write ideas on the board</span>

```{r}
library(classdata)
head(fbiwide)
```


## Plan for answers

- Explore how one (or more) variables are distributed: *barchart or histogram*
- Explore how two variables are related:  *scatterplot, boxplot, tile plot*
- Explore how two variables are related, conditioned on other variables: *faceting, color & other aesthetics*


We will be using the `ggplot2` framework for plotting

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


## Why `ggplot2`

- Wildly popular package for statistical graphics: over 2.5 million downloads from CRAN in 2017 (several thousand times per day)
- Developed by Hadley Wickham (An ISU Alumni)
- Designed to adhere to good graphical practices
- Constructs plots using the concept of layers
- Supports a wide variety plot types and extensions
- Ported to different languages, e.g. `ggpy`
\medskip
- http://ggplot2.org/book/ or Hadley's book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis* for reference 




## `ggplot` Function

The `ggplot` function is the basic workhorse of ggplot2

- Produces all plot types available with ggplot2
- Allows for plotting options within the function statement
- Creates an object that can be saved
- Plot layers can be added to modify plot complexity

## `ggplot` Structure

The `ggplot` function has the basic syntax:

`ggplot(data, mappings) + geom_type(options)`

- data: dataset to be used
- mappings: determines which variables are connected to which plot elements, mappings are done with `aes()`
- type: determines type of the plot, e.g. `point`, `line`, `bar`
- options: there are so, so many options!

## Scatterplots in `ggplot2`

`aes` allows us to specify mappings; scatterplots need a mapping for `x` and a mapping for `y`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
  geom_point()
```

- <span style="color:white">Draw a scatterplot of the number of burglaries by murders.</span>
- <span style="color:white">Adjust the numbers of the above scatterplot to show log transformed numbers. How can we interpret the numbers on the axes?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Draw a scatterplot of the log transformed number of burglaries by motor vehicle thefts.</span>

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Murder))) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft))) +
  geom_point()
```  

## Revision - Interpreting Scatterplots

- Big patterns
    - Form and direction
    - Strength
- Small patterns
- Deviations from the pattern
    - Outliers
    

## Aesthetics

Can map other variables to size, colour, shape, ....

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           colour=Year), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

- <span style="color:white">Draw a scatterplot of the log transformed number of burglaries by motor vehicle thefts. Map the state variable to colour. Why is this a terrible idea?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Draw a scatterplot of the log transformed number of burglaries by motor vehicle thefts. Map Population to size. How do we interpret the output?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Which other aesthetics are there? Have a look at the [RStudio cheat sheet on visualization](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) </span>

<span style="color:white">**Stretch goal**: Draw a histogram of the state populations. </span>

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft), colour = Year)) + geom_point()

ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft), colour = State)) + geom_point()

ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft), size = Population)) + geom_point() 

ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(Population)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(Population)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~ State)
```
