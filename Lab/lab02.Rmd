 Lab #2<br> chocolate tasting

## Outline

- Find your team members
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to everybody
- Do a data exploration (on chocolate ratings )
- Create an R markdown file that contains all code to read the data and create the plots
- Submit!


# Find your team members

## github repository

1. Log into github 
2. Pick one team member to create a repository called 'lab2'
3. Go into the settings of the repository and add your team members as collaborators



## Background

Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, obviously likes chocolate. He has assembled a database of ratings for plain dark chocolate bars: [Flavors of chocolate](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html)

By now, over 1800 different chocolate bars have been rated. 

## Meaning of ratings

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

- 5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
- 4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
- 3= Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
- 2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
- 1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)




## Reading the data

The file `choco.csv` at https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv is a web scraping from the chocolate flavor data base.

You can load the data into your session using the command below:

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

# A data exploration

## Question set (team)

Answer each of the following questions using R code to get an answer. When asked for a plot, use the `ggplot2` package. 

1. What is the overall  number of chocolate bars rated?
2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
3. Upload your RMarkdown file to the repository

## Question set (individual)

Download the RMarkdown file from the repository.

3. For each of the questions below  provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.
    1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
    1. Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar? 
    2. How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings:
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    top3 <- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
    ```

Upload your answers to the repository. Discuss and refine answers as a team.


## Your own question? (team)

1. Discuss a question you want to investigate.
2. Answer this question by graphs.
3. Conclusions.

## Submission

In Canvas, submit an RMarkdown file with: 

  a. the names of all team members that worked on the document;
  b. a link to the github repo you were working in;
  c. code and answers to all of the questions;
  d. the question you want to investigate with its answers and conclusions;
  e. one paragraph commenting on the workflow;
  f. a html or pdf file of the final output.


Due date: You have time until Monday at 10 pm to submit the final RMmarkdown and html/pdf files.
